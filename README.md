## Test Cases for Group Project

I added some test cases for a critical eventForm component in our manage events page, where users can update or create new events.
This test can be found here:

Here is a photo of the test cases passing:

## Test Driven Development – Pros & Cons:
Test driven development is a very interesting software development methodology where tests are written before the implementation of the code, I have outlined some of the pros and cons of this method below:

Pros:

•	Aligns people on the requirements of the code – with specific tests already outlined it is much clearer what actually needs to be implemented by the developer.

•	Ensures quality code with clear and thoughtful testing occurring.

•	Ensures that testing process is not rushed because it is completed before development, not at the end when deadlines might be closing and tests could be ignored.

•	Ensures confidence in the final code because it was designed with respect to the tests that were identified to prove the code as valid.

Cons:

•	Most developers are taught with a implementation first testing after methodology so they have to learn a new method which has a start-up cost and could have a learning curve that could slow development in the short term.

•	Writing tests first may seem to slow down the development process initially because you are spending more time writing these test cases instead of implementing – and it can be hard to look past the initial cost that will likely speed up development down the line because of the clearer requirements.

•	It may be difficult to think about all the tests that will be needed during implementation before this occurs. It is possible problems come up or a requirement changes and you will need to add more or change tests which could introduce inefficiency.
Overall, TDD is a really interesting methodology for software development and certainly has its benefits and drawbacks, which need to be carefully considered by the development team for them to determine if it is appropriate for their team.
